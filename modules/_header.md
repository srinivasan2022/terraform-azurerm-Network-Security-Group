## What is Network Security Group ?

An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a core component of Azure's security fabric. Leveraging an NSG, you can filter traffic to and from Azure resources that you have commissioned on an Azure Virtual Network (VNet). At its core, an NSG is effectively a set of access control rules you assign to an Azure resource.
